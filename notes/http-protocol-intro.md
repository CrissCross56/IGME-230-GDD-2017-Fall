## What is a Web Server?

A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web. The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.

## The HTTP Protocol
HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. 

A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
