# JavaScript Variables, Types and Scope

## Overview
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures

Dynamic Typing: it is not necessary to declare the *type* of a variable ahead of time. The type will get determined automatically while the program is being processed. 

## Data Types
### Core Data Types
- Boolean
- Number
- String
- Object

- Null:  a nonexistent or invalid object or address.
- Undefined: a value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.
- Symbol: a data type having the quality that values of this type can be used to make object properties that are anonymous. https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/metaprogramming-in-es6-symbols/
