# Web Server Intro
## Overview
Web servers store, process, and deliver web pages and other files to *client* programs such as web browsers. This is known as the *client-server* model where servers that are connected to the Internet store resources (text, images, audio, ...) and wait for *requests*. The *client* applications will then request these resources as needed.

## Terms (hopefully you already know these)
* The **Internet** is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. [wikipedia.org - Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)
* The **World Wide Web (WWW)** is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. [wikipedia.org - WWW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)
* **Web servers** store, process, and deliver web pages and other files to *clients*. This is also know as the **request-response** pattern. [wikipedia.org - Web Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) &  [Request-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request–response)
* Examples of **clients** include a web browser that downloads and displays web pages, a search engine that downloads, catagorizes and stores images, or a mobile app that downloads and plays audio files. [wikipedia.org - Client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing))
* Examples of computer applications that use the **client–server** model are Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web. [wikipedia.org - Client-Server Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client–server_model)
* The **HTTP (Hyper-text Transfer Protocol)** is a communication *protocol* (set of rules) that governs how web servers and client applications communicate.  HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.  [wikipedia.org - HTTP Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
