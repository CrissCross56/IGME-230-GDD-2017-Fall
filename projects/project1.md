# Project 1 - Game Proposal Site
For project 3, you will be making a Web game or app. To get you started thinking about this early, you’ll be building a site to promote and document the project. Don't worry too much about what you'll be capable of, or the fact that your specs will probably change. Just think about what you might want to make. I'd also suggest you keep an eye on the Web for what sorts of apps and games other people are making that are small enough in scope for you to build in the span of a few weeks.

## Requirements ##
Location: The page will be located in the project1 directory in your 230 directory on Banjo. This means that the location of page on the web will be http://people.rit.edu/abc1234/230/project1/ (where 'abc1234' is your RIT id), as shown below:

![Structure](Project1Structure.png)

Your main page for the tutorial will be the index page for this directory. You must have css and media directories to store the associated files.

## Required Content ## 
- The title of what the tutorial is for.
- A Brief description of the tutorial.
- At least 6 steps in the tutorial, spread over at least 2 pages.
- Recognizable images for the tutorial steps. Images should be in a web friendly image format (gif, jpg, or png) and of appropriate resolution for the web.
- Brief instructions for each step.
- Optional: Any other information about the item the tutorial is for. This could be links to the item, information about the item, etc. Put this content is a separate <div>, or in an <aside>. 
o	At least one other page, matching your main page's design and navigation, that tells me the following:
♣	Why you chose this topic
♣	How you went above and beyond the base requirements and anything special you want me to see that might not be immediately obvious
♣	How you could have improved
♣	Cite the sources of all information, tutorials, images and other media used
o	You are, of course, free to add additional pages as they make sense within the context of your tutorial.
•	HTML Markup (mechanics) - The HTML on the page will be valid, clean, and accurate: 
o	valid means that it will meet the current HTML5 standard. Run your page through the HTML validator at http://validator.w3.org/  to be sure that it meets the standard. 
o	clean means that your HTML source code is hand-coded by you (no WYSIWYG editors allowed) with enough white space and indenting to make it easy to read and debug. 
o	accurate means that you chose the proper semantic tags to mark up your content. For example, list items are represented by <li> tags, not <br />tags. Spacing should be accomplished by using CSS styles rather than empty <p> tags, and so on. 
•	HTML5 Markup: 
o	Structural tags like <header> , <section> , <article>, <nav>, and <footer> should be used appropriately. 
•	CSS - Cascading Style Sheet - selectors and rules will be used for formatting and positioning: 
o	The style rules will be located in an external style sheet.
o	There will be at least 5 style declarations (rules) in your document. 
o	At least one of your style declarations will utilize a class selector.
o	At least one of your style declarations will utilize an id selector.
•	Design: 
o	College Level Work
o	Professionally styled up so that so that the results are pleasing and in no way resemble the templates or in-class exercises. The page design will be well thought out with appropriate organization, spacing, colors and fonts, and all pages should be consistent in look, feel and navigation.
o	Design principles (e.g. CRAP) applied appropriately.
o	Text should be of sufficient size and contrast to be easily readable
•	Responsive Design: 
o	At a minimum, you must support screen sizes equal to or less than max-width: 480px
o	Your design should be re-formatted to support these smaller screens. Changing font-size, margins, moving side bars, hiding elements, and ??? are all options

•	Other requirements: 
o	HTML tables used only for tabular data, not page layout.
o	No Flash content
o	Site is fully accessible even without graphics enabled
o	Additional "above and beyond" work.
•	Critique Session
o	The second class of week 7, we will have a critique session in class. In small groups, you will both give and receive feedback on your projects, so be prepared for this discussion.
o	While the critiques aren’t going to directly determine your project grade, the feedback you receive will be taken into consideration, so make sure your project is built to impress!
•	Final Submission
o	After receiving feedback from your classmates, make fixes and improvements to your site, and post it to Banjo before midnight on Friday of week 7.
Submission: Post to Banjo - be sure to test that it works in a web browser. I must be able to get to it from your page when I click your name in my class list, so make sure to link to it from your main page. If your main page doesn't load when I click my link, or I can't immediately find a way to get to your project from that main page, you will get a 0 for the project. Please check when you upload it!
