# HW - Create a 230 home page

## Overview
For this assignment you will create a personal 230 "home page" where you will be able to post links to the exercises and projects you will complete for this course. For those of you have not touched HTML & CSS since taking IGME-110, it will also function as a refresher on how to create a basic Web page, a directory (folder) structure, and post files to a Web server.

## Requirements
Your page's design is up to you, but it needs to contain the following elements:
* A level-1 heading that reads "YOUR NAME's 230 Page" (replacing "YOUR NAME" with your own name, obviously)
* A **recognizable** photo of yourself (not the back of your head, not a drawing, not you wearing a mask)
* A brief bio about yourself (a paragaph will do), telling me about your interests and your goals; what do you hope to get out of the class, your major, your time at RIT, and where do you want to be when you graduate?
* Placeholder links to the following:
  - Each of the 3 class projects
  - Your in-class exercises (which will be added as links every day); just include a section on the page for these
* A link back to our class list page
* A pleasing (or at least tolerable) color scheme and layout, using your CRAP principles and other design guidelines
* Your page needs to pass W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validation
  - In order to pass and be legible, you also need to *fix Banjo* (see the FixingBanjo.zip file). If you don't do this, you will lose points on **every** assignment.
