# Week 3A - CSS Positioning and HTML Tables

## Topics
- HTML tables
- Review: inline, embedded, and external CSS
- Classes and IDs
- Review of float
- Positioning types:
  - static, or how we've done everything so far
  - relative, or a position relative to where the element would be if it were unpositioned
  - absolute, or a position relative to an element's container
  - fixed, or a position relative to the top left of the window
- z-index
- visibility
- overflow

## Review and Demo
Together, we will build a page demonstrating tables, the different types of positioning, as well as embedding fonts, all using an external CSS file. The table tags to note are:
```
<table>
<th>
<tr>
<td>
the colspan attribute
the border-collapse:collapse CSS selector and value, which removes the border space between table cells
```

## CSS Positioning
There's a lot of contention in the Web world on how to position and control elements on a page. The most common approaches now are to utilize floats, margins, and flexible elements (sized in % or a similar relative measurement). However, understanding and applying more precise positioning is very useful when we get to DOM manipulation!
