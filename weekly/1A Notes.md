## Discussion
This course is not focused on "web design", but instead on developing highly interactive web applications and web games that heavily utilize the JavScript programming language.  The major topics of this course are split roughly into thirds:
- web publishing (HTML/CSS) both "from scratch", and with the Bootstrap CSS framework
- web application development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript & a little PHP)
- web game development (JavaScript & the Pixi.js rendering engine)

Once you complete this course you should be able to do the following:
- publish a "traditional" multi-page website to the WWW. The content will be properly "chunked" and the site navigation will be intuitive and easy to use.
- publish a single-page application (SPA) web site "portfolio". You can see an example here: http://dougwatro.com - this example has eight distinct "pages" of content that are presented on a single web page.
- code a web application that can connext to web services, and download/display their data. Examples inlcude a music searching and previewing applications that use the iTunes API, and a GIF viewing application that utilizes the Giphy API.
- code a DOM web game that uses HTML/CSS for the User Interface, and JavaScript for game logic & interactivity. Examples include card games and typing games.
- code a sprite-based game such as a shooter or platformer utilizing JavaScript and Pixi.js
