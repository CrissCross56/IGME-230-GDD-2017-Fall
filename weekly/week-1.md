# Week 1 Notes
## Overview
Web servers store, process, and deliver web pages and other files to *client* programs such as web browsers. This is known as the *client-server* model where servers that are connected to the Internet store resources (text, images, audio, ...) and wait for *requests*. The *client* applications will then request these resources as needed.

This week we will:
* discuss what a web server is (and does)
* discuss the HTTP protocol
* learn how to script certain web server behavior by utlizing .htaccess files
