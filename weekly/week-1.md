# Week 1 Notes
## Overview
Welcome to IGME-230 Web Site Design & Implementation! There is more to this course than the title implies, as we will be learning a lot more than just the design and implementation of static web sites. 

## What this course is about
Official description from SIS: *This course provides an introduction to web development tools and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and DHTML, AJAX, web platforms and environments, and server-side programming methods.*
We will:
* review basic web publishing (HTML/CSS/FTP) and HTML validation
* learn how a web server works and how to do basic scripting of it
* expose you to the PHP scripting language that runs on most web servers
* explore advanced CSS layout utilizing the CSS box model and flex box
* go beyond *type*, *class*, and *id* CSS selectors by utilizing advanced CSS 3 selectors
* construct **web applications**. A web app is a clientâ€“server software application in which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser. Examples of web apps you might use are github.com, Gmail, and Google Drive. Web App assignments we will complete in class include interactive calculators, a functional "To do" app, an app that allows the user to search for and view animated GIFs, and an app that allows the user to search the iTunes store for songs, and then listen to previews
* construct **interactive games** that run in the web browser (these are also considered to be web applications):
  * utilizing the DOM (Document Object Model) we will build an interactive concentration game, and a typing game. These games will rely heavily on CSS 3 features such as CSS transformations (rotate & skew), and CSS keyframed animations
  * utilizing the Pixi.js rendering framework, we will build sprite-based games such as simple shooters and top/down adventure games.
* learn how to add advanced interactivity to web pages. Building web apps and web games requires knowledge of more than just HTML & CSS, but also of the JavaScript programming language that runs in all web browsers. We will be covering the current "standard" version of JavaScript known as ES5 (ECMAScript 5), as well as some of the well-supported and powerful features of ES6 (AKA ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015)
* utilize a CSS framework such as Bootstrap to construct a responsive web portfolio
When the course is complete, you will hopefully have at least the beginnings of a "portfolio piece" or two that you will be able to show to prospective employers.
  

## Topics
This week and next we will:
* discuss what this course is about and where it fits in the GDD curriculum
* point you to IGME-110 resources you may need to review
* discuss what a web server is (and does)
* discuss the HTTP protocol and see it how it works
* learn how to script certain web server behavior by utilizing .htaccess files

## Prerequisites

I expect students in this class to have a basic working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and publishing to RIT's web hosting environment (people.rit.edu). This material was covered in IGME-110.

If you need to brush up on your HTML and CSS skills, I recommend using the CodeAcademy tutorials that we currently use in IGME-110: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web, lessons 1-5. We will be doing a very brief review, but you shouldn't expect to rely on that to cover all of the prerequisite knowledge.

You will also need a GitHub account, and the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) so that you can create and access private repos.

If you have questions between now and the start of class, feel free to send me an email!
