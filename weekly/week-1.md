# Week 1 Notes
## Overview
Web servers store, process, and deliver web pages and other files to *client* programs such as web browsers. This is known as the *client-server* model where the servers store resources (text, images, audio, ...) and wait for requests, and the client applications request these resources as needed.

This week we will talk about what a web server is (and does), and learn how to script some of its behavior.
