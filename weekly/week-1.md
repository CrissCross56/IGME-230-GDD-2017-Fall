# Week 1 Notes
## Overview
Welcome to IGME-230 Web Site Design & Implementation! There is more to this course than the title implies, as we will be learning a lot more than just the design and implementation of static web sites. 

## What this course is about
Official description from SIS: *This course provides an introduction to web development tools and technologies, such as X/HTML, CSS, Javascript and DHTML, AJAX, web platforms and environments, and server-side programming methods.*
We will:
* review basic web publishing (HTML/CSS/FTP) and HTML validation
* learn how a web server works and how to do basic scripting of it
* expose you to the PHP scripting language that runs on most web servers
* explore advanced CSS layout utilizing the CSS box model and flex box
* go beyond *type*, *class*, and *id* CSS selectors by utilizing many of the CSS 3 selectors
* construct **web applications**. A web app is a clientâ€“server software application in which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser. Examples of web apps you might use are github.com, Gmail, and Google Drive. Web App assignments we will complete in class include interactive calculators, a functional "To do" app, an app that allows the user to search for and view animated GIFs, and an app that allows the user to search the iTunes store for songs, and then listen to previews
* construct **interactive games** that run in the web browser (these are also considered to be web applications):
  * utilizing the DOM (Document Object Model) we will build an interactive concentration game, and a typing game. These games will rely heavily on CSS 3 features such as CSS transformations (rotate & skew), and CSS keyframed animations
  * utilizing the Pixi.js rendering framework, we will build sprite-based games such as simple shooters and top/down adventure games.
* learn how to add advanced interactivity to web pages. Building web apps and web games requires knowledge of more than just HTML & CSS, but also of the JavaScript programming language that runs in all web browsers. We will be covering the current "standard" version of JavaScript known as ES5 (ECMAScript 5), as well as some of the well-supported and powerful features of ES6 (AKA ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015)
* utilize a CSS framework such as Bootstrap to construct a responsive web portfolio
