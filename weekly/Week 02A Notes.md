## The layers of Web design
	1. Content
	1. Structure
	1. Presentation
	1. Behavior

## Demo
Together, we'll build a Web page, reviewing the following:
   - Basic markup and structure
   - Structural and semantic elements
   	- Structural markup is using to encode information about the structure of a document. Examples: `<heading>, <footer>, <div>, and <span>`
	- Semantic markup means using tags that add meaning to the content. Examples: citations, acronyms, quoted text, lists, emphasized text
Structural markup such as <div> delineate major sections of the document and are also block-level elements that sit on their own line. 
Semantic markup such as <cite> add extra information without altering the structure of a document, and may be either inline or block elements.


## HTML Skeleton
This is the bare minimum needed for a valid HTML document:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
