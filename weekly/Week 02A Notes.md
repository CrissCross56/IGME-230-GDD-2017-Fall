## Review and Demo
Together, we'll build a Web page, reviewing the following:
   - Basic markup and structure
   - Structural and semantic elements
   	- Structural markup is using to encode information about the structure of a document. Examples: `<heading>, <footer>, <div>, and <span>`. Structural markup such as `<div>` delineates major sections of the document and are also block-level elements that sit on their own line. 
	- Semantic markup means using tags that add meaning to the content. Examples: `<cite>, <quot>, <ul>, <ol>, <em>`. Semantic markup such as `<cite>` adds extra information without altering the structure of a document, and may be either inline or block elements.
   - HTML5 structural tags enhance our structure and give us more to work with later on:
   	- `<header>, <main>, <nav>, <aside>, <figure>, <footer>`, etc.

## HTML Skeleton
This is the bare minimum needed for a valid HTML document:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
	<title></title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
