Discuss the server!
FTP review:
   - Creating a local 230 directory
   - Reminder: keep backups, bring a flash drive to class; the 230 folder is where all work will be done moving forward.
   - Connect to Banjo (banjo.rit.edu, port 22) and upload that 230 directory to have it there for when we need it.
   - Review permissions (at this point, you shouldnâ€™t need to change these, but just in case)
   - Reminder: Banjo is the FTP name, while the browser accesses people.rit.edu
   - Navigate to that directory via browser, and you should see nothing. Note that we will be building actual pages shortly.

Then, server slides, and [htaccess ICE](../exercises/.
