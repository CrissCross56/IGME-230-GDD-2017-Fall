Discuss the server!
First, review FTP. Demo:
   - Create a local 230 directory
   - Remind students about backups and that this is where all there work will be done moving forward.
   - Connect to Banjo (banjo.rit.edu, port 22) and upload that 230 directory to have it there for when we need it.
   - Review permissions (at this point, they shouldnâ€™t need to change this, but just in case)
   - Also remind them that Banjo is the FTP name, while the browser accesses people.rit.edu
   - Navigate to that directory via browser, and should see nothing. Maybe slap a text file in there. Note that we will be building actual pages shortly.

Then, server slides, and htaccess ICE.
